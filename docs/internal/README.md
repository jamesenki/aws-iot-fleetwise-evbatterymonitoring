## Architecture Diagram File Guidance

- For more detailed guidelines see this Wiki documentation: https://w.amazon.com/bin/edit/AWS/Solutions/SolutionsTeam/Teams/Automotive/DiagramStandards
- Add source files as XML to the documentation/internal/diagram_source_files folder
- Add SVG files (normal size, non-transparent background, no embedded/copy of diagram included) to the appropriate module documentation folder
- Keep a 1 to 1 relationship between source files and SVGs so it is easy to find diagram source files (i.e. don't include multiple pages of diagrams in one XML)
